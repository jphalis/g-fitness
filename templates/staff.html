			<p class="text" style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;">Fitness and Sports have been a way of life for me, and I understand the dedication and commitment it takes to become your personal best. In high school, I excelled in Football, Wrestling, and Lacrosse earning coaches awards in all three sports, as well as All Conference Honors and being named Captain. Throughout my college career, I was a standout, two sport varsity athlete competing in football and lacrosse, earning a coveted award for “going above and beyond the call of duty.” My dedication and hard work brought me to a place many people only dream of, the NFL. Just being on the same field with some of these amazing athletes was an honor. It was something most children believe in and talk themselves out of later in life. I teach athletes how to excel and encourage them to reach for the stars, hence the star in G Fitness.

			<br/>

			For the past 10 years I have helped friends and colleagues train. Realizing that my strengths lie in my ability to motivate others and in my love of training and fitness, I have devoted myself to personal training. My sports background gives me an edge that most personal trainers don’t have. My personality is all about winning and being your best. If you want a trainer to truly bring out the best in you, to push you further than you ever dreamed possible, I am your trainer and G Fitness is the place to go.</p>

			<p class="text" style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;">At a young age, sports have always been a huge passion of mine, from watching them on T.V. to playing on the field myself. Since I was about fourteen, I played various sports, but Lacrosse had captured my interest the most. While attending school, I played for Watchung Hills High School and then Fairleigh Dickinson University. After college, I played for the American Lacrosse League and multiple pick up leagues. Finally, I decided to coach the game. Finding that coaching was my true passion, I started with my first team, Warren’s Eighth Grade Boys Lacrosse, as the Defensive Coordinator.  From there, I was offered a great opportunity to become Head Coach for the Girls Lacrosse at William Annin Middle School. After one year, I was hired at Ridge High School as Assistant Coach for the Varsity Men’s Lacrosse team, where we won the State Title and the 2013 Tournament of Champions. Going into my second season with my team for 2014, I’m proud to be Head Coach of the Ridge JV Men’s Lacrosse.</p>
