    	<p class="text">Get the body you want while improving your health and energy, boosting your self confidence, and becoming your personal best. While Nike’s slogan of “Just Do It” sounds great, most of us do not have the motivation and determination to stick with a fitness program on our own and do what it takes to get the body we have always dreamed of. “Losing weight” and “getting in better shape” are the top New Year’s resolutions year after year, but few people stick with their resolutions. Most of us fall victim to the media’s latest gimmicks that we all know don’t work. Even more of us believe that if we ignore the problem by wearing different clothes and trying to hide it people wont notice. The fact is that all of these options seem great but the only way that you will truly be happy with the way you look is by working out under professional guidance.</br></br>

    	<h4 class="text-header" style="text-align: center;">Athlete Training</h4><hr/>
    	<p class="text">Along with a team of expert trainers and former college and pro athletes we bring teams and athletes to the highest level possible. The focus is “Off Field Training,” using techniques such as “over speed training,” lateral resistance band work, dynamic leg exercises, and explosive upper body work, molding athletes to play their best. A significant amount of time is allotted to injury prevention since only healthy athletes can perform at their finest.<br/><br/>

		Based on the John Wooden “Pyramid of Success” (a model used by the top college programs in the country) we understand the building a foundation based on strength, speed, agility and injury prevention makes for a more explosive, stable, and durable athlete. Focusing energy on “making the play” simply is not enough. Working hard does not always mean you are doing the right thing. Find out the difference at G Fitness.</p>
